  <h2>Recent Trip</h2>
  <p>
    We just got back from a concert trip to Kansas City, and wow—the city was beautiful and the airport was one of the nicest I’ve ever seen. Since we packed everything into a two-day weekend, we didn’t have much time for sightseeing. We flew in early Saturday morning, went straight to the concert check-in, grabbed BBQ at a nearby spot, and spent the evening at the show before checking into our hotel. The next morning we hit another famous BBQ place, then wrapped up the trip exploring the airport’s little shops and restaurants before flying home.

  <h2>My Pets</h2>
  <p>I can't pick favorites so here are my pets. We chose Asian inspired names and kept their adopted names as middle names:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bao Alice (My Bunny)</li>
    <li>Kimchi Stormy (My Bunny)</li>
    <li>Miso Giselle (My Cat)</li>
    <li>Yuzu Honey (My Kitten)</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Restaurant -->
  <h2>Favorite Restaurant</h2>
  <p>
    My favorite restaurant right now is
    <a href="https://www.mellowmushroom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mellow Mushroom</a>
    because their menu changes seasonally, they have a large drink menu, and many options for entrees
    depending on how you’re feeling.

  <!-- Food -->
  <h2>Favorite Food</h2>
  <img class="food" src="images/tacos.png" alt="Tripas Tacos on a plate" />
  <p>
    My favorite food is Tripas Tacos (tripe). Tripe is a staple in my favorite dishes growing up
    Vietnamese American, and I also love Mexican culture. I usually eat them with just onions and
    cilantro absolutely <strong>drowned in lime</strong> — and nothing else!
